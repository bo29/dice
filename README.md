# dice
Dice simulator
This is an alpha build of a dice simulator, specifically for use in table-top RPGs. The Die object created in Die.java allows the user to create a single die that has 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, or 100 sides. The Dice object created in Dice.java allows the user to create any combination of these. The user can roll, set the default value, get the value, and for Dice, they can get the sum of all dice in one group along with how many sides each Die had.
